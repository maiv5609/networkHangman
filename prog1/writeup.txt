1.) Victor, Preston, Owen
2.) When the server prints out the board state there is some junk characters towards the end of the buffer. This could be due to an error in printing/memory. 
3.) First we tested among our own client and server with short words, med. words, and long words. We tested losing, winning, single character guesses, and multi character guesses. We initally had errors with long words and getting correct input and output. We fixed this and later had issues with multi character guesses which we also fixed. After fixing any errors we found we also tested the server and client with other groups in the class. Multiple client testing was also done without any problems. 
4.) The most challenging aspect of the assignment was getting the networking working correctly. We had a lot of issues with sending and recieving the correct data types and lining those up correctly. Debugging was also difficult because the results we were getting were not consistent over the network.
