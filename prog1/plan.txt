1. We are building a game of hangman where the server enforces the rules. Multiple clients can connect to the server to play the game by submitting guesses. The server will limit
the number of guesses the client is able to make and if client runs out of guesses, they lose the game. If the client guesses the word correctly and still have guesses, they will
win the game. We will implement server.c/server.h and client.c/client.h. Both server and client will make sockets and handle binding them. Server will take advantage of the fork()
function to allow the server to have multiple clients that can concurrently play the game. 

2. We anticipate the networking to be the most challenging aspect. We all are fairly competent writing code in C so the game will straight forward.
None of us have prior networking experience and will spend most of our time working on that portion.

3. We will refer to client_demo and server_demo for networking examples, visit office hours (because we love professors) and using the internet/book for reference materials.

4. We plan to meet Monday, Wednesday and Friday 10-11 and 1-2 and possible weekend meetings if needed.
